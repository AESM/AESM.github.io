      <h1>Tech Issues</h1>
      <h4>Net Neutrality</h4>
      <h5>2014/11/02</h5>
      <p class="words">Net Neutrality is currently a very important issue in tech, as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed an “Internet Fast Lane” that would allow certain websites operate at higher speeds.  The FCC has stated that it would create rules preventing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from blocking or slowing down access to content providers that don't pay a toll to reach consumers.  However, many opponents have stated that these rules could open the door for broadband providers to cut deals with larger companies, such as Google, that provide massive amounts of content.  These deals would be detrimental to smaller companies, because they would create high rates for the fast lanes which only larger companies could afford.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>With no restriction, companies will get throttled in terms of speed and data-flow allowed to their customers.  If there are too many regulations, than a tiered Internet design is formed, controlled by the ISPs, to the benefit of larger corporations.</p>

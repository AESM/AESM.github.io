      <h4>The Compass Of Shame</h4>

      <p class="words"><strong>The Compass of Shame</strong> is a representation of how we respond to difficult feelings such as anger, fear, but primarily shame.  Everyone falls on each end of the compass and uses the different strategies at different times.</p>

      <p class="words"><br><strong>Withdrawal</strong> – When something difficult happens, you physically or emotionally leave.  The Benefit: They know how to take their time and remove themselves from the trigger.<br><strong>Avoidance</strong> – When something difficult happens, you avoid the shame/emotion by getting into something else.  The Benefit: They get a lot done and are great to party with.<br><strong>Attack-Self</strong> – When something difficult happens, you take negative feedback, thoughts, or emotions and compound it.  The Benefit: They never harm anyone, there is something really loving about that.<br><strong>Attack-Other</strong> – When something difficult happens, you take out your frustrations on someone else.  The Benefit: They're really assertive and know how to stand their ground.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>For quite a few years after high school, I fell deep into Avoidance territory.  I dawdled, plain and simple.  I was going to Junior College, but I was more interested in throwing parties, organizing events, going on the road, and doing everything except for focusing on my future.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Interestingly enough, I don't regret this.  I wasted quite a bit of time and money switching majors and partying, especially because deep down, I knew I was running away from something.  Only when I was able to admit that I was trying to escape the "get a diploma as soon as possible" path I was raised believing in, was I able to realize that I was learning valuable skills that were actually applicable to the life I wanted to lead.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Just like emotions, there is nothing wrong with these strategies, we all have them, but we need to learn how to own and control them.  Don't compound the shame, don't feel bad for having the impulse – instead acknowledge the natural impulse and choose to not give into it.</p>

      <h1>Thinking Style, Learning Style</h1>
      <h4>The Story So Far</h4>
      <h5>2014/10/27</h5>
      <p class="words">Entering the program, I thought that I would need to work on my patience, stress control, and fear.  Forth week in, I realize that my greatest strength and occasionally weakness is confidence.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>I was worried, because my most effective learning style is getting to work with my hands.  Typing in a bunch of commands doesn't quite have the same affect, does it?  But the only fear I had was of giving into fear of failure during the course.  The only stress I had to overcome was the worry that the burden would be too much and stress me out.  The redundancy department revoked my rights to feel these feelings (did it again, BOOSH!) partway through the course apparently, because I got all "I can do anything if I something something!"</p>

      <p class="words"><br>The drive helped me dive right into the material without any worry.  The moment I felt comfortable in the waters curiosity took over, making sure I understood every concept and the associating application,  The only thing I'm trying to balance out now, is when to stop digging deeper â€“ I find that I need to become better acquainted with the concept of Timeboxing, because I keep losing myself in many rabbit holes along the way.</p>

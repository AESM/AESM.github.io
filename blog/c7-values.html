      <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h4>Scale Of Values I Try To Live Up To</h4>
      <h5>2014/11/23</h5>

      <p class="words">Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Ambition: 5</p>
      <p class="words"><br>Accomplishment: 5</p>
      <p class="words"><br>Confidence: 4</p>
      <p class="words"><br>Creativity: 5</p>
      <p class="words"><br>Credibility: 4</p>
      <p class="words"><br>Inspiration: 3</p>

      <p class="words"><br>I was asked to think of the times in your life where I've been "the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied."  It is pretty up and down depending on my situation (on top of the world socially while working a cozy job one minute, to being jobless and spending all of my time being anti-social the next), but the values above were easy to identify.  They all seem to feed off of each other, causing the values to grown or sink, but the most important has always been accomplishment.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>"You are what you accomplish."  No idea when that idea got in my head, but it has always been a driving force in my life.  The more I achieve, the more ambitious I become.  The greater the achievement, the more inspired and confident (which leads to my credibility as well as creativity) I become.  This is my way of feeling like I not only exist, but that my existence matters.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>I find it interesting that my drive increases just by thinking about my values and the idea of what I believe in.  Maybe that is what prevents me from giving into the "young and defeated" Ali that "awesome-dude who can do anything" Ali is based on.  If and when I doubt my abilities and feel like giving up, I just take a look at everything else I have bested, and where I am today.</p>

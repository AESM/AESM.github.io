<p class="words"><h4 class="l">What are the benefits of version control?</h4>
<span class="l">Version control keeps track of all files pertaining to a project, of all the changes made to a project, of who made the changes, of when the changes were made, of each version, and keeping the master branch separate from the various versions that exist.  If something gets messed up along the way, you can roll back to an earlier version of the project and all of the changes are bundled up into a commit/savepoint.  This adds a degree of security and flexibility to your work.</span>

<h4 class="l">How does git help you keep track of changes?</h4>
<span class="l">When you upload a project to GitHub, you can allow multiple people to work on the project at the same time, but each will be working on their own branch/version of the project, so no one will be getting in the way of anyone else.  When changes are made, everyone working on the project can see those changes.  When working solo, the ability of git to track the changes and versions of your work is very useful if you need to see what you have done in the past or roll back to a previous version if you break your code.<span>

<h4 class="l">Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
<span class="l">GitHub helps when a project/file needs to have multiple individuals work on it from separate computers or locations.  These collaborators don't need to wait for one person to finish working on a project and have it e-mailed to them, because they can all work on the same files at the same time and use merging (taking commits/savepoints from multiple people and combining them) to create a completed file.</span>
<span class="l">When the project at hand is personal (only one contributor), it is still beneficial to use GitHub because of its tracking capabilities and how it saves remote versions of your code.</span></p>

      <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
      <h4>A Love Story</h4>
      <h5>2014/10/27</h5>
      <p class="words">A Collection can contain objects, classes, and pretty much anything else.  Items inside of a collection are referred to by an index.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>An Array is a data structure that works as a collection, used to store items and keep track of them.  It is represented by brackets [] which enclose the items held within the array.  Each item in an array is known as an Element.
      <br>Every slot in the list acts like a variable: you can see what object a particular slot points to, and you can make it point to a different object.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Each slot an array is given an Index Number.  The Index is the pointer to where an object is inside of the array.  In Ruby, the index starting index (the first slot) is always zero.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>The pop method will remove and return the last element of the array.  If a number n is given as an argument, the return will be an array of the last n elements (or less).</p>
      <p class="words">The push method allows you to send in any given objects to the end of an array, using an argument.  This expression returns the array itself, so several appends may be chained together.</p>
      <p class="words">The join method joins all the elements of an array together into one big string, if the array is filled with strings.  The argument that is passed to the join() method, the Separator, is what shows up between every element of the array that is joined.</p>
      <p class="words">The sort method will sort items in the array for you based on their values.  If you want to modify the original array, use the sort! method.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>A Hash is a container for data, specifically a collection of key/value pairs.</p>
      <p class="words">Similar to arrays, hashes are data structures that can store any kind of data.  Unlike arrays, hashes do not get at the data by using its position or index (they are unordered collections), and you can use any object to refer to a slot (not just a number).</p>

      <p class="words"><br>This is unlike objects in an array, which are assigned a position in an ordered list.</p>
      <p class="words">The data is organized into “Key/Value pairs” and have a more complicated syntax than arrays.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>The Key is used as the address and the Value is the data at that address.  Keys in the hash must be unique.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>A Key in a hash refers to a specific value.</p>
      <p class="words">A key is usually going to be a string, symbol, or number.</p>

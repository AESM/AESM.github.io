      <h4>(Technically)</h4>
      <h5>2014/10/19</h5>
      <p class="words">
<p class="words">A fresh start with new tools – ones that meet halfway between simplicity in design & complexity of computation, allowing me to build product.  Build art.  My kind of tools.
<br>I'm now two weeks into my Dev Bootcamp journey, one week has been spent working with HTML & CSS.  I have dabbled with them before, like a child poking undercooked peas with a “Masters of the Universe” spork, but never anything too in depth.  This week spent diving into the inner-workings of these languages has been inspiring.  HTML, powerful yet simplistic.  CSS, lightweight yet complex.  Again.  My kind of tools.
<br>In the grand scheme of things, I have been left satisfied after every endeavor.  No task has felt too tedious, confusing, or lackluster.  Maybe I'm a masochist, but this is art to me.  I wouldn't use the word frustration to describe my study sessions...  Except for a few rounds with one, little property...</p>
<h4 class="l">What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h4>
<p class="words">Positioning.  According to [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) “The CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element. It can also place an element behind another, and specify what should happen when an element's content is too big.”  Sounds like a simple property, designed to make your life easier.  Honestly, it is, but only after you figure out the difference between all four of the attributes and how to properly use them.  I'm going to try sum them up as best as I can, because this was the concept that gave me the most trouble, until I realized that the rules were rather simple:</p>
<h3 class="l">Static</h3>
<p class="words">Static Positioning is where an element will be placed by default.  If you add something to your page, this is where it will land, & this form of positioning will say, “Now Stay!”  That's it.  The Top, Right, Bottom, & Left properties can't move a static object, end of story.</p>
<h3 class="l">Fixed</h3>
<p class="words">Fixed Positioning elements are positioned relative to the browser.  Set it wherever you want on your screen.  Feel good about the spot it's in?  Good, because you're going to stare at it for a long while.  Think of it like putting a sticker on your monitor – even if you scroll, your object isn't going anywhere.  It will go as far as to overlap your other elements.</p>
<h3 class="l">Relative</h3>
<p class="words">Relative Positioning is positioned relative to its normal position.  Plop the element down on your page, it will stay there.  Scroll away from that spot of the screen, the element will go with it.  You can easily reposition them, they can overlap other elements, but that space, belongs to them.</p>
<h3 class="l">Absolute</h3>
<p class="words">Absolutely Positioned elements are positioned relative to the first parent element in the HTML hierarchy, that is not statically bound.  Big.  Fat.  Jerk. Until you understand each other.  All of the sudden you are best friends! Directional attributes are totally usable, it can overlap other elements, you can literally place the element wherever you want.  A major issue which I had to mess around with to properly understand, is that the document and all of the other elements pretend that it doesn't exist – absolutely positioned elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page.</p>
<p class="words"><br>I had to bang my head against the wall for a while before I figured out how to get each of these to place nicely together, but it is surprisingly rather simple after you grasp them conceptually.</p>

      <h4>... And I'll Tell You Who You Are</h4>

<p class="words">"Don't ever quit running, even if you're ahead."

  <br>I used to have this saying pasted on my ceiling, so it would be the first thing I would see every morning.  It helped me remember to try something new, learn a new skill, or strengthen a connection everyday.  That is always true, until it isn't.  Until I found myself settling, then I need that reminder again.

  <br>The kitchen mentality from the video with Shereef speaks loudly to this goal of mine.  The idea of jumping into this immersive program where they jam-pack your brain with both technical and social knowledge in a short amount of time, so you can mold it into your own experience for growth, is a bit scary, but even more than that, it's thrilling.

  <br>While I have some technical background, it is nothing compared to what I will have at the end of Dev Bootcamp.  There were some difficult portions of this first week of Phase 0, but that sense of accomplishment, plus the knowledge gained the moment the material clicked, washes away all of the fear of failure - in this course and in life.

  <br>At this point, I'm incredibly excited about the developing community and what we can do.  With a strong community, there is nothing that you can't accomplish.  I'm eagerly anticipating the energy, support, cooperation, and discussions of the onsite intensive portion.  This feels like my kind of culture.</p>

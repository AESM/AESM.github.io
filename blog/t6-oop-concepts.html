      <h1>Classes vs Modules</h1>
      <h4>Storage Wars!</h4>
      <h5>2014/11/17</h5>
      <p class="words">Classes and Modules appear to be rather similar: the syntax used to create each is comparable, structurally they are almost identical.  However, classes have a bit more power when it comes to creation and control.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>A Class is a collection of methods and data, that are used as a blueprint to create multiple objects relating to that class.  As a definition of a concept, classes are a way to bundle and define behaviors (methods) and to create multiple objects with similar behaviors easily.  The class is responsible for launching the object into existence, a process known as Instantiation; but the object, thereafter, has a life of its own.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Modules serve as containers for data, methods, classes, constants, or even other modules.  Module containers are very useful for sharing behavior between your classes, are frequently used for namespacing classes and constants in your programs, and can augment your existing classes/objects with different behaviors.  NameSpacing is a way of bundling logically related objects together, allowing methods, classes, constants, or modules with conflicting names to co-exist while avoiding collisions with each other (like files with the same names being kept in separate folders).</p>

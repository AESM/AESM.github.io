      <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
      <h4>How Has That Been Working Out For You Anyway?</h4>
      <h5>2014/11/09</h5>
      <p class="words">Pairing has been an interesting experience thus far - as part of DBC's program, students have been given the assignment to team up in teams of two approximately twice a week.  The team is to practice honesty, teamwork, cooperation, and feedback to complete coding challenges.  There are two roles that the pair participants must each fulfill for a fair amount of time, the Driver and the Navigator.  This is similar to going on a road trip, except the code is road.  Essentially, the Navigator tells the their partner what line to write what code on, while the Driver types out the code.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>There have been some instances in which individuals get stuck because their idea of how to go about solving the problem is different from their partner's.  Other times, individuals have very different styles of communication and they need to figure out how to not get caught up on unimportant matters.  On the other hand, there are pairing soul-mates that bounce ideas off one-another, learning new tricks along the way, and just work together as an incredibly well-oiled machine.</p>
      <!--  -->
      <p class="words"><br>Altogether, this hasn't been the easiest task in the world, but I think that is why this is beneficial - we'll have to deal with people who will always believe that their way is correct, without ever listening to their peer's input.  Learning how to cooperate with peers in any situation is going to be a powerful tool for us, all throughout life.  Also, being able to take feedback from our peers here, opens up our eyes to the habits (good and bad) that we do, whether or not we realize they exist.</p>

      <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h4>Can't Hold Me Back</h4>
      <h5>2014/11/17</h5>
      <p class="words">As an American of half Middle-Eastern decent that grew up in a predominantly white community, I've dealt with my fair share of stereotyping.  There were other factors that were the cause (and affect) of my early lack of social skills and courage to communicate when I didn't understand something, but the irrational "may as well give up" plays on repeat in my head when study material gets difficult, is always accompanied by reminders of that "skinny little camel jockey" who never felt good enough.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Bony, hairy, unathletic, idiot, terrorist - kids say the darnedest things, even though they probably didn't know what half of the insults they threw my way meant.  Didn't matter, all of these insults too this day occasionally resurface.  They are ingrained into my identity, as the kid I was.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>I say that in the past-tense, because this was me.  This made me.  I learned how to push beyond the stereotype that were built just for Ali.  There was a point in my life where I realized I was the quickest with comebacks because I didn't actually feel sorry for myself, I had built up social skills that others couldn't even dream of wielding, and I had the intelligence to learn whatever I was interested in as long as I didn't let my own personal stereotype threat get the best of me.</p>

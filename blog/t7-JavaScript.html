      <p class="words">Ruby, you will always be my first love in the realm of learning to program.  You're also the basis of biased opinions from this point on.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Because of my history with Ruby, JavaScript wasn't terribly difficult to pick up.  At the same time, it introduced me to the world of confusion that one must conquer on their way to becoming polyglot programmers.  Similar concepts have different names.  Even worse, concepts that are unheard of in certain languages, share the names of existing concepts!  MADNESS!</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Let's do a compare and contrast, shall we?  In Ruby, you would use a class to create an object, which would then have all of the abilities of the class it belongs to.  JavaScript can do the same thing, except classes are replaced by functions.</p>

      <p class="words"><br>Take a look at the examples above.  In Ruby, You define a class by beginning and ending with `class` and `end`.  You create methods (which give your objects behaviors) in a similar manner, beginning and ending with `def` and `end`.  Functions in JavaScript begin with the keyword `function` and all of the other information falls within an open bracket `{` followed by a closed bracket `}`.  Another important difference, is that after every JavaScript Statement (line of code in JavaScript), you must include a semi-colon `;` to signify that the line is complete (like a period at the end of a sentence).</p>
